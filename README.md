# Image Matching and Logistic Regression

This code performs image matching using various techniques such as cross-correlation, convolution, and sum of square root. It also includes logistic regression for classification and feature engineering using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The code aims to compare images, classify them, and evaluate the performance of the models.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- scikit-image (skimage)
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install opencv-python pillow scikit-image numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
## Image Matching

The image matching part of the code performs the following steps:

1. Preprocessing: The code reads images from the testing directory, resizes them to 32x32 pixels, and converts them to grayscale.
2. Combinations: It creates combinations of image paths and image pairs to compare.
3. Labeling: Labels are assigned based on whether the images belong to the same class or not.
4. Matching: The code compares the image pairs using the matching technique (cross-correlation, convolution, or sum of square root) and applies a threshold to determine the similarity.
5. Evaluation: The code calculates the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure scores for the image matching results.

The results of the image matching process will be displayed, including the confusion matrix and evaluation scores.

## Logistic Regression

The logistic regression part of the code performs the following steps:

1. Data Preparation: It flattens the image pairs obtained from the image matching process.
2. Model Training: The code trains a logistic regression model using the flattened image pairs and their corresponding labels.
3. Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the labels for both the training and testing image pairs.
4. Evaluation: The code calculates the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure scores for the logistic regression predictions.

The results of the logistic regression process will be displayed, including the evaluation scores.

## Feature Engineering (PCA)

The feature engineering part of the code performs the following steps:

1. Dimensionality Reduction: It applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the image pairs obtained from the image matching process.
2. Data Preparation: The code flattens the PCA-transformed image pairs.
3. Model Training: It trains a logistic regression model using the flattened PCA-transformed image pairs and their corresponding labels.
4. Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the labels for both the training and testing PCA-transformed image pairs.
5. Evaluation: The code calculates the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure scores for the logistic regression predictions on the PCA-transformed data.

The results of the feature engineering process will be displayed, including the evaluation scores.

## Usage

1. Place your training images in the `training` directory.
2. Modify the code to specify the paths to your training and testing image directories, or replace the existing paths with your own.
3. Run the code.
